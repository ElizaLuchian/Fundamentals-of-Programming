In this code, you use a stack to explore different possibilities of combining coins to reach the target sum. The outer loop runs as long as there are items in the stack, and within the loop, you examine the current state:

If rest (the remaining sum to reach the target) is 0, you've found a valid payment modality, and it's added to the finalmoney list.

If rest is negative, you discard this branch of the exploration (backtrack).

If rest is positive and not equal to 0, you continue exploring by adding coins to curr2 and pushing the updated state onto the stack.

In the worst case, you might need to explore all possible combinations of coins to find all valid modalities. Therefore, the time complexity of this code is exponential, O(2^n), where 'n' is the number of coins. This is because, in the worst case, you are exploring all possible subsets of coins to make up the target sum, and there are 2^n possible subsets.

The space complexity is determined by the size of the stack and can also be exponential in the worst case. 
Your code appears to be working correctly for finding payment modalities, but it may not be efficient for large inputs due to the exponential time complexity. If you need a more efficient solution, you can consider dynamic programming, as shown in the previous code examples.
